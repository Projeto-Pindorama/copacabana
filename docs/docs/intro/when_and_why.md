# Introduction
## What is the Pindorama project?
*Translated to english from the [website](http://pindorama.twilightparadox.com/):*  
> Pindorama is a project that produces **FREE** and intelligent software,
> following principles of modularity, simplicity and sanity.
> It started (and still being) something personal and hobistic from a group of
> friends, who started the project around the end of June 2019.
> We seek to maintain sanity and competence as a proudly Brazilian open-source project.

## What is Copacabana Linux?

## How did Pindorama started?
### The "INU Project"
**Everything** goes back when i started using Linux, in the end of 2018. It was
everything new, i was just getting out of the "VirtualBox Plato's cave" and
started using Linux on bare metal.  
In that same year, i met Caio Novais (i will call him `chexier`, which is his nickname), 
which at the first time wasn't *exactly* my friend --- in fact, we just used to start flame wars 
about computing  (more specifically, about Linux) in a forum, with no further intent besides 
trolling each other -- but, later on, we became friends and started thinking about starting an 
open-source project or something (althought having almost no knowledge about programming), so
we, two 14 year old brats, created a GitHub profile and start doing some really amateur Shell scripts. 
At the time, the name of our """project""" was INU, an obvious pun on the name GNU.  
I think it was a good start, because although our code being really amateur, we
learnt a lot --- not nearly as much as we would be learning until today, but it was a start.  

We didn't had a lot of significant activity until something between June or July
2019, when we trew "INU" away and started Pindorama, so i will skip part of the
year of 2019 here.

### The genesis of Pindorama
In mid May 2019, my computer's power supply just blew up (it was what we call "fonte bomba"
here in Brazil, literally "bomb power supply", so i was, in some way, expecting it to happen);
so, while i haven't enough money to fix it, i had to use an old Lenovo G450 --- 
which ran Windows 7, and for some reason, although being "designed to run Windows
7", it was terribly slow; so I was going to need to run Linux on bare metal again.  
Cool, eh? No, it wasn't.  
Since the laptop wasn't *really* mine, I couldn't just overwrite 
the Windows partition with Linux, so I was going to need to use a Live environment.  
The one that i remember (negatively) the most is [antiX Linux](http://antixlinux.com/).
I can describe it simply as being a Debian rebrand with some hacks made using
Python (plus PyQt) and Shell that made the distribution even worse (in the sense of
being rigid) to use.
In short, it seemed that the author was more concerned with doing some kind of 
political activism against the USA/"The West", liberalism, capitalism and corporations 
(in special Red Hat *et caterva*) rather than making an usable Linux live distribution.
I don't want to be an elitist bastard here, the main idea is really good, but it was 
unfortunately poorly executed and blind by political ideals.  
So, after suffering for a while, I've called `chexier` and talked about creating a
Debian remix (in brazilian software communities, it's called a "refisefuquis") for 
running from a pendrive or a CD-ROM and that I could run in any x86 machine
(including the ones from my school, that at the time were avaible to all students
at the institution). It wasn't my goal to debunk antiX, I just wanted to have a 
system to use until I fixed my main computer.  
And it's here where the "Pindorama Project" starts.
