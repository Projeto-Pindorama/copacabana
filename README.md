# The Copacabana Linux distribution
This repository contains most of the resources that you'd need to build
Copacabana, in case documentation and scripts.

Most of my work here is based on Derrick's [Musl-LFS](https://github.com/dslm4515/Musl-LFS)/[CMLFS](https://github.com/dslm4515/CMLFS),
which i'm also contributing with code and fixes for. :^)  

It follows the same building model that "vanilla" LFS and Musl-LFS/CMLFS does,
so our build is divided into cross-tools, tools and the final system.  

You can already download the cross-tools stage for Copacabana from Pindorama's
FTP server, just enter in pindorama.twilightparadox.com (port 2121), it's inside
the copacabana/ directory.  

For testing, i'm using Pindorama's Mitzune, a tool that i've developed
specifically for this task.  

I'll describe the entire process of in fact building the system in the docs.
