This repository contains most of the resources that you would need to build
Copacabana, in case a build consolidation made of small scripts that
automate the process.  

For more information about porting, translation, documentation etc, read
the website: http://copacabana.pindorama.dob.jp  

For more technical information about the distribution itself, read the
Copacabana tabula at the Silicon Tabula:

## Some credits and acknowledgements
Luiz Antônio Rangel (`takusuman`), for the most part of the work --- including making Heirloom and lobase work;  
Caio Novais (`caioyoshimura`), for fixes and hacks with Shell script and dotfiles;  
Kayo Henrique (`Tamboru`) for all the graphics-related work. Seriously, the distribution
and the project itself wouldn't even have a logo if it wasn't him.  

And obviously, Copacabana wouldn't even exist if it wasn't the work of Linus
Torvalds and thousands of millions of contributors in the [Linux
kernel](http://kernel.org), neither without Gerard Beekmans' [Linux from
Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) manual.
