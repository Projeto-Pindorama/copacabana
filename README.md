# The Copacabana Linux(R) distribution
![Pindorama Copacabana Linux](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Projeto-Pindorama/artworks/master/Pindorama%20Copacabana%20Banner/Pindorama%20Copacabana%20Banner.png)   

This repository contains most of the resources that you'd need to build
Copacabana, in case documentation and scripts.

Most of my work here is based on Derrick's [Musl-LFS](https://github.com/dslm4515/Musl-LFS)/[CMLFS](https://github.com/dslm4515/CMLFS),
which i'm also contributing with code and fixes for. :^)  

It follows the same building model that "vanilla" LFS and Musl-LFS/CMLFS does,
so our build is divided into cross-tools, tools and the final system.  

You can already download the cross-tools stage for Copacabana 1.0 (Sunrise) from 
the "Releases" section.  

For testing, i'm using [Pindorama's Mitzune](https://github.com/Projeto-Pindorama/mitzune), 
a tool that i've developed specifically for this task.  
The virtual disk image is being mounted using [Pindorama's lemount](http://github.com/Projeto-Pindorama/lemount), 
that's why any mentions to the Copacabana mounted disk partition are prefixed
`/dsk/Xp` --- where `X` is a number, usually `0` in the documentation since this is
the only and first image that i have mounted in my host --- , and `p` is
a prefix -- ` ` (NULL) when it's a real disk and `v` when it's a virtual one, which will be our case in
the documentation.  

I'll describe the entire process of in fact building the system in the docs.

The documentation is actually deployed at Silicon Tabula using MkDocs:

## platforms
For now, it's only being compiled for x86_64, but we intend to have it running
at least in x86_64, i586 and ARM; but, if Copacabana becames popular and we got
more resources for the distribution, we can port it for other architectures as
well.

## how to contribute
### "i want snapshots to be released more often"
First of all, it's done when it's done; but we think that 4 hours compiling just
the C compiler isn't productive as much as actually making the distribution.  
If you want releases to be made more often, you can donate to me, Luiz, specifically ---
since I'm the main maintainer and Copacabana is being cross-compiled from my machine.  
It'd help us a lot, since with some funding I will can upgrade my current hardware and
do things faster.

This will also help a lot projects that are currently maintained only by me, such as
Mitzune, lemount, isainfo, the Silicon Tabula etc.  

### be a "Bugbuster"
Fixing bugs is important too. If there's something strange in some code, what you
gonna do? Fix it and pull-request it!  
You can just Issue it too if you don't have any particular skills with programming.  

### spread the word!
Kayo Henrique made some cool badges for Copacabana, they're avaible at our
[artworks repository](https://github.com/Projeto-Pindorama/artworks).  
We strongly encourage that you use these badges freely over the Net and the real
life.  
Put them in your website, stick them on your Workstation or Laptop, use it
freely --- within the bounds of good taste and common sense, of course.

## credits and acknowledgements
Luiz Ant√¥nio Rangel (`takusuman`), for the most part of the work --- including making Heirloom and lobase work;  
Caio Novais (`caioyoshimura`), for fixes and hacks with Shell script and dotfiles;  
Kayo Henrique (`Tamboru`) for all the graphics-related work. Seriously, the distribution
and the project itself wouldn't even have a logo if it wasn't him.  

And obviously, Copacabana wouldn't even exist if it wasn't the work of Linus
Torvalds and thousands of millions of contributors in the [Linux
kernel](http://kernel.org), neither without Gerard Beekmans' [Linux from
Scratch](http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/) manual.
